abstract = {Short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) observed by Swift potentially reveal the first insight into cataclysmic compact object mergers. To ultimately acquire a fundamental understanding of these events requires pan-spectral observations and knowledge of their spatial distribution to differentiate between proposed progenitor populations. Up to 2012 April, there are only some 30 per cent of SGRBs with reasonably firm redshifts, and this sample is highly biased by the limited sensitivity of Swift to detect SGRBs. We account for the dominant biases to calculate a realistic SGRB rate density out to z ≈ 0.5 using the Swift sample of peak fluxes, redshifts and those SGRBs with a beaming angle constraint from X-ray/optical observations. We find an SGRB lower rate density of 8 +5 −3 Gpc −3 yr −1 (assuming isotropic emission) and a beaming corrected upper limit of 1100 +700 −470 Gpc −3 yr −1. Assuming a significant fraction of binary neutron star mergers produce SGRBs, we calculate lower and upper detection rate limits of (1-180) yr −1 by an Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Virgo coincidence search. Our detection rate is similar to the lower and realistic rates inferred from extrapolations using Galactic pulsar observations and population synthesis.},

abstract = {The presence of a nearby companion alters the evolution of massive stars in binary systems, leading to phenomena such as stellar mergers, x-ray binaries, and gamma-ray bursts. Unambiguous constraints on the fraction of massive stars affected by binary interaction were lacking. We simultaneously measured all relevant binary characteristics in a sample of Galactic massive O stars and quantified the frequency and nature of binary interactions. More than 70{\%} of all massive stars will exchange mass with a companion, leading to a binary merger in one-third of the cases. These numbers greatly exceed previous estimates and imply that binary interaction dominates the evolution of massive stars, with implications for populations of massive stars and their supernovae.},

abstract = {We present the full panchromatic afterglow light curve data of GW170817, including new radio data as well as archival optical and X-ray data, between 0.5 and 940 days post-merger. By compiling all archival data, and reprocessing a subset of it, we have ensured that the panchromatic dataset is uniform and therefore immune to the differences in data processing or flux determination methods used by different groups. Simple power-law fits to the uniform afterglow light curve indicate a t0.86±0.04 rise, a t−1.90±0.12 decline, and a peak occurring at 155 ±4 days. The afterglow is optically thin throughout its evolution, consistent with a single spectral index (−0.569 ± 0.002) across all epochs. This gives a precise and updated estimate of the electron power-law index, p = 2.138 ± 0.004. By studying the diffuse X-ray emission from the host galaxy, we place a conservative upper limit on the hot ionized ISM density, {\textless}0.01 cm−3, consistent with previous afterglow studies. Using the late-time afterglow data we rule out any long-lived neutron star remnant having magnetic field strength between 1010.4 G and 1016 G. Our fits to the afterglow data using an analytical model that includes VLBI proper motion from Mooley et al., and a structured jet model that ignores the proper motion, indicates that the proper motion measurement needs to be considered while seeking an accurate estimate of the viewing angle.},

abstract = {Double neutron star (DNS) systems represent extreme physical objects and the endpoint of an exotic journey of stellar evolution and binary interactions. Large numbers of DNS systems and their mergers are anticipated to be discovered using the Square-Kilometre-Array searching for radio pulsars and high-frequency gravitational wave detectors (LIGO/VIRGO), respectively. Here we discuss all key properties of DNS systems, as well as selection effects, and combine the latest observational data with new theoretical progress on various physical processes with the aim of advancing our knowledge on their formation. We examine key interactions of their progenitor systems and evaluate their accretion history during the high-mass X-ray binary stage, the common envelope phase and the subsequent Case BB mass transfer, and argue that the first-formed NSs have accreted at most ∼ 0.02 M☉. We investigate DNS masses, spins and velocities, and in particular correlations between spin period, orbital period and eccentricity. Numerous Monte Carlo simulations of the second supernova (SN) events are performed to extrapolate pre-SN stellar properties and probe the explosions. All known close-orbit DNS systems are consistent with ultra-stripped exploding stars. Although their resulting NS kicks are often small, we demonstrate a large spread in kick magnitudes which may, in general, depend on the past interaction history of the exploding star and thus correlate with the NS mass. We analyze and discuss NS kick directions based on our SN simulations. Finally, we discuss the terminal evolution of close-orbit DNS systems until they merge and possibly produce a short $\gamma$-ray burst.

abstract = {Merging binary neutron stars are thought to be formed predominantly via isolated binary evolution. In this standard formation scenario, the first-born neutron star goes through a recycling process and might be rapidly spinning during the final inspiral, whereas the second-born star is expected to have effectively zero spin at merger. Based on this feature, we propose a new framework for the astrophysical characterization of binary neutron stars observed from their gravitational wave emission. We further propose a prior for the dimensionless spins of recycled neutron stars, given by a gamma distribution with a shape parameter of 2 and a scale parameter of 0.012, extrapolated from radio pulsar observations of Galactic binary neutron stars. Interpreting GW170817 and GW190425 in the context of the standard formation scenario, we find positive support (with a Bayes factor of 6) for a spinning recycled neutron star in GW190425, whereas the spin of the recycled neutron star in GW170817 is small and consistent with our prior. We measure the mass of the recycled (slow) neutron star in GW170817 and GW190425 to be 1.34−+00..1209 (1.38+0−0..1111) M☉ and 1.64+0−0..1311 (1.66+0−0..1212) M☉, with 68{\%} credibility, respectively. We discuss implications for the astrophysical origins of these two events and outline future prospects of studying binary neutron stars using our framework.},

Since September 2015,10 binary black hole coalescences and one binary neutron star coalescence have been observed. They have provided remarkable, revolutionary insight into the "gravitational Universe" and have greatly extended the field of multi-messenger astronomy. At present, Advanced LIGO can see binary black hole coalescences out to redshift 0.6 and binary neutron star coalescences to redshift 0.05. This probes only a very small fraction of the volume of the observable Universe. However, current technologies can be extended to construct "{\$}3{\^{}}\backslashmathrm{\{}rd{\}}{\$} Generation" (3G) gravitational-wave observatories that would extend our reach to the very edge of the observable Universe. The event rates over such a large volume would be in the hundreds of thousands per year (i.e.tens per hour). Such 3G detectors would have a 10-fold improvement in strain sensitivity over the current generation of instruments, yielding signal-to-noise ratios of 1000 for events like those already seen. Several concepts are being studied for which engineering studies and reliable cost estimates will be developed in the next 5 years.},

The transformative coincident gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 gave invaluable insights into these cataclysmic collisions, probing bulk nuclear matter at supranuclear densities, the jet structure of gamma-ray bursts, the speed of gravity, and the cosmological evolution of the local Universe, among other things. Despite the wealth of information, it is still unclear when the remnant of GW170817 collapsed to form a black hole. Evidence from other short gamma-ray bursts indicates a large fraction of mergers may form long-lived neutron stars. We review what is known observationally and theoretically about binary neutron star post-merger remnants. From a theoretical perspective, we review our understanding of the evolution of short- and long-lived merger remnants, including fluid, magnetic-field, and temperature evolution. These considerations impact prospects of detection of gravitational waves from either short- or long-lived neutron star remnants which potentially allows for new probes into the hot nuclear equation of state in conditions inaccessible in terrestrial experiments. We also review prospects for determining post-merger physics from current and future electromagnetic observations, including kilonovae and late-time x-ray and radio afterglow observations.},

abstract = {Long-duration, spectrally-soft Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are associated with Type Ic Core Collapse (CC) Supernovae (SNe), and thus arise from the death of massive stars. In the collapsar model, the jet launched by the central engine must bore its way out of the progenitor star before it can produce a GRB. Most of these jets do not break out, and are instead "choked" inside the star, as the central-engine activity time, {\$}t{\_}{\{}\backslashrm e{\}}{\$}, is not long enough. Modelling the long-soft GRB duration distribution assuming a power-law distribution for their central-engine activity times, {\$}\backslashpropto t{\_}{\{}\backslashrm e{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-\backslashalpha{\}}{\$} for {\$}t{\_}{\{}\backslashrm e{\}}{\textgreater}t{\_}{\{}\backslashrm b{\}}{\$}, we find a steep distribution ({\$}\backslashalpha\backslashsim4{\$}) and a typical GRB jet breakout time of {\$}t{\_}{\{}\backslashrm b{\}}\backslashsim 60\backslashtext{\{} s{\}}{\$} in the star's frame. The latter suggests the presence of a low-density, extended envelope surrounding the progenitor star, similar to that previously inferred for low-luminosity GRBs. Extrapolating the range of validity of this power law below what is directly observable, to {\$}t{\_}{\{}\backslashrm e{\}}{\textless}t{\_}{\{}\backslashrm b{\}}{\$}, by only a factor of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}4-5 produces enough events to account for all Type Ib/c SNe. Such extrapolation is necessary to avoid fine-tuning the distribution of central engine activity times with the breakout time, which are presumably unrelated. We speculate that central engines launching relativistic jets may operate in all Type Ib/c SNe. In this case, the existence of a common central engine would imply that (i) the jet may significantly contribute to the energy of the SN; (ii) various observational signatures, like the asphericity of the explosion, could be directly related to jet's interaction with the star.},

It powers a torus-like pulsar wind nebula with jets, dubbed the Dragonfly, which is very similar to that of the Vela pulsar. The Dragonfly is likely associated with the extended TeV source VER J2019+368 and extended radio emission. We conducted first deep optical observations with the GTC in the Sloan {\$}r'{\$} band to search for optical counterparts of the pulsar and its nebula. No counterparts were detected down to {\$}r'\backslashgtrsim27.2{\$} and {\$}\backslashgtrsim24.8{\$} for the point-like pulsar and the compact X-ray nebula, respectively. We also reanalyzed Chandra archival X-ray data taking into account an interstellar extinction--distance relation, constructed by us for the Dragonfly line of sight using the red-clump stars as standard candles. This allowed us to constrain the distance to the pulsar, {\$}D=1.8{\^{}}{\{}+1.7{\}}{\_}{\{}-1.4{\}}{\$} kpc at 90{\%} confidence. It is much smaller than the dispersion measure distance of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}12 kpc but compatible with a {\$}\backslashgamma{\$}-ray "pseudo-distance" of 1 kpc. Based on that and the optical upper limits, we conclude that PSR J2021+3651, similar to the Vela pulsar, is a very inefficient nonthermal emitter in the optical and X-rays, while its {\$}\backslashgamma{\$}-ray efficiency is consistent with an average efficiency for {\$}\backslashgamma{\$}-pulsars of similar age. Our optical flux upper limit for the pulsar is consistent with the long-wavelength extrapolation of its X-ray spectrum while the nebula flux upper limit does not constrain the respective extrapolation.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}With the first observation of a binary neutron star merger through gravitational waves and light, GW170817, compact binary mergers have now taken the center stage in nuclear astrophysics. They are thought to be one of the main astrophysical sites of production of r-process elements, and merger observations have become a fundamental tool to constrain the properties of matter. Here, we review our current understanding of the dynamics of neutron star mergers in general and of GW170817 in particular. We discuss the physical processes governing the inspiral, merger, and postmerger evolution, and we highlight the connections between these processes, the dynamics, and the multimessenger observables. Finally, we discuss open questions and issues in the field and the need to address them through a combination of better theoretical models and new observations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We use the public Advanced LIGO data which covers the period from 2015 through 2017 and contains ∼ 164 days of LIGO-Hanford and LIGO-Livingston coincident observing time. The search was conducted using matched-filtering using the PyCBC toolkit. We find no significant binary neutron star candidates beyond GW170817, which has previously been reported by searches for binaries in circular orbits. We place a 90 {\%} upper limit of ∼ 1700 mergers Gpc−3Yr−1 for eccentricities . 0.43 at a dominant-mode gravitational-wave frequency of 10 Hz. The absence of a detection with these data is consistent with theoretical predictions of eccentric binary neutron star merger rates. Using our measured rate we estimate the sensitive volume of future gravitational-wave detectors and compare this to theoretical rate predictions. We find that, in the absence of a prior detection, the rate limits set by six months of Cosmic Explorer observations would constrain all current plausible models of eccentric binary neutron star formation.},

abstract = {A MHz gravitational wave search for harmonic sources was conducted using a 704 h dataset obtained from the Holometer, a pair of 40 m power recycled Michelson interferometers. Our search was designed to look for cosmic string loops and eccentric black hole binaries in an entirely unexplored frequency range from 1 to 25 MHz. The measured cross-spectral density between both interferometers was used to perform four different searches. First, we search to identify any fundamental frequencies bins that have excess power above 5$\sigma$. Second, we reduce the per-bin threshold on any individual frequency bin by employing that a fundamental frequency and its harmonics all collectively lie above a threshold. We vary the number of harmonics searched over from n = 4 up to n = 23. Third, we perform an agnostic approach to identify harmonic candidates that may have a single contaminated frequency bin or follow a power-law dependence. Lastly, we expand on the agnostic approach for individual candidates and search for a potential underlying population of harmonic sources. Each method was tested on the interferometer dataset, as well as a dark noise, photon shot-noise-limited, and simulated Gaussian-noise datasets. We conclude that these four different search methods did not find any candidate frequencies that would be consistent with harmonic sources. This work presents a new way of searching for gravitational wave candidates, which allowed us to survey a previously unexplored frequency range.},

abstract = {We have calculated synchrotron spectra of relativistic blast waves, and find predicted characteristic frequencies that are more than an order of magnitude different from previous calculations. For the case of an adiabatically expanding blast wave, which is applicable to observed gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows at late times, we give expressions to infer the physical properties of the afterglow from the measured spectral features. We show that enough data exist for GRB970508 to compute unambiguously the ambient density, n=0.03/cm**3, and the blast wave energy per unit solid angle, E=3E52 erg/4pi sr. We also compute the energy density in electrons and magnetic field. We find that they are 12{\%} and 9{\%}, respectively, of the nucleon energy density and thus confirm for the first time that both are close to but below equipartition. For GRB971214, we discuss the break found in its spectrum by Ramaprakash et al. (1998). It can be interpreted either as the peak frequency or as the cooling frequency; both interpretations have some problems, but on balance the break is more likely to be the cooling frequency. Even when we assume this, our ignorance of the self-absorption frequency and presence or absence of beaming make it impossible to constrain the physical parameters of GRB971214 very well.},

The arcsecond GRB localizations available within just a few minutes of the GRB alert has signified the continual sampling of the GRB evolution through the prompt to afterglow phases revealing unexpected flaring and plateau phases, the first detection of a kilonova coincident with a short GRB, and the identification of samples of low-luminosity, ultra-long and highly dust-extinguished GRBs. The increased numbers of GRB afterglows, GRB-supernova detections, redshifts and host galaxy associations has greatly improved our understanding of what produces and powers these immense, cosmological explosions. Nevertheless, more high-quality data often also reveal greater complexity. In this review, I summarize some of the milestones made in GRB research during the Swift era, and how previous widely accepted theoretical models have had to adapt to accommodate the new wealth of observational data.},

Such collisions will produce a characteristic burst of gravitational radiation, which may be the most promising source of a detectable signal for proposed gravity-wave detectors. Such signals are sufficiently unique and robust for them to have been proposed as a means of determining the Hubble constant. However, the rate of these neutron-star collisions is highly uncertain. Here we note that such events should also synthesize neutron-rich heavy elements, thought to be formed by rapid neutron capture (the r-process). Furthermore, these collisions should produce neutrino bursts and resultant bursts of $\gamma$-rays; the latter should comprise a subclass of observable $\gamma$-ray bursts. We argue that observed r-process abundances and $\gamma$-ray-burst rates predict rates for these collisions that are both significant and consistent with other estimates. {\textcopyright} 1989 Nature Publishing Group.},

We find that a few 10−3 M⊙ of material are ejected dynamically during the mergers. The amount and the properties of these outflow depend on binary parameters and on the NS equation of state (EOS). A small fraction of these ejecta, typically ∼10−6 M⊙, is accelerated by shocks formed shortly after merger to velocities larger than 0.6 c and produces bright radio flares on timescales of weeks, months, or years after merger. Their observation could constrain the strength with which the NSs bounce after merger and, consequently, the EOS of matter at extreme densities. The dynamical ejecta robustly produce second and third r-process peak nuclei with relative isotopic abundances close to solar. The production of light r-process elements is instead sensitive to the binary mass ratio and the neutrino radiation treatment. Accretion disks of up to ∼0.2 M⊙ are formed after merger, depending on the lifetime of the remnant. In most cases, neutrino- and viscously-driven winds from these disks dominate the overall outflow. Finally, we generate synthetic kilonova light curves and find that kilonovae depend on the merger outcome and could be used to constrain the NS EOS.},

abstract = {We discuss jet dynamics for narrow and wide gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow jets and the observational implications of numerical simulations of relativistic jets in two dimensions. We confirm earlier numerical results that sideways expansion of relativistic jets during the bulk of the afterglow emission phase is logarithmic in time and find that this also applies to narrow jets with half opening angle of 0.05 rad. As a result, afterglow jets remain highly nonspherical until after they have become nonrelativistic. Although sideways expansion steepens the afterglow light curve after the jet break, the jet edges becoming visible dominates the jet break, which means that the jet break is sensitive to the observer angle even for narrow jets. Failure to take the observer angle into account can lead to an overestimation of the jet energy by up to a factor of four. This weakens the challenge posed to the magneter energy limit by extreme events such as GRB090926A. Late-time radio calorimetry based on a spherical nonrelativistic outflow model remains relevant when the observer is approximately on-axis and where differences of a few in flux level between the model and the simulation are acceptable. However, this does not imply sphericity of the outflow and therefore does not translate to high observer angles relevant to orphan afterglows. For more accurate calorimetry and in order to model significant late-time features such as the rise of the counterjet, detailed jet simulations remain indispensable. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {Mergers of binary neutron stars usually result in the formation of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). Whether and when this remnant collapses to a black hole (BH) depends primarily on the equation of state and on angular momentum transport processes, both of which are uncertain. Here, we show that the lifetime of the merger remnant may be directly imprinted in the radioactively powered kilonova emission following the merger.We employ axisymmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations of remnant accretion discs orbiting an HMNS of variable lifetime, and characterize the effect of this delay to BH formation on the disc wind ejecta. When BH formation is relatively prompt (≲100 ms), outflows from the disc are sufficiently neutron rich to form heavy r-process elements, resulting in {\~{}}week-long emission with a spectral peak in the near-infrared (NIR), similar to that produced by the dynamical ejecta. In contrast, delayed BH formation allows neutrinos from the HMNS to raise the electron fraction in the polar direction to values such that potentially Lanthanide-free outflows are generated. The lower opacity would produce a brighter, bluer, and shorter-lived{\~{}}day-long emission (a 'blue bump') prior to the late NIR peak from the dynamical ejecta and equatorial wind. This new diagnostic of BH formation should be useful for events with a signal to noise lower than that required for direct detection of gravitational waveform signatures. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {We present a powerful new tool for fitting broadband gamma-ray burst afterglow data, which can be used to determine the burst explosion parameters and the synchrotron radiation parameters. By making use of scale invariance between relativistic jets of different energies and different circumburst medium densities, and by capturing the output of high-resolution two-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical (RHD) jet simulations in a concise summary, the jet dynamics are generated quickly. Our method calculates the full light curves and spectra using linear radiative transfer sufficiently fast to allow for a direct iterative fit of RHD simulations to the data. The fit properly accounts for jet features that so far have not been successfully modeled analytically, such as jet decollimation, inhomogeneity along the shock front, and the transitory phase between the early-time relativistic and late-time non-relativistic outflow. As a first application of the model we simultaneously fit the radio, X-ray, and optical data of GRB 990510. We find not only noticeable differences between our findings for the explosion and radiation parameters and those of earlier authors, but also an improved model fit when we include the observer angle in the data fit. The fit method will be made freely available on request and online at http://cosmo.nyu.edu/afterglowlibrary. In addition to data fitting, the software tools can also be used to quickly generate a light curve or spectrum for arbitrary observer position, jet, and radiation parameters. {\textcopyright} 2012.

Here we present the measurement of the redshift of the galaxy, the putative host galaxy of GRB 970228, and, based on its spectroscopic and photometric properties, identify the galaxy as a subluminous but otherwise normal galaxy at redshift z $\backslash$ 0.695 undergoing a modest level of star formation. At this redshift, the GRB released an isotropic-equivalent energy of (1.4 {\^{}} 0.3) ] 1052 ergs (20{\`{E}}2000 keV rest frame). We Ðnd no evidence that the host is signiÐcantly bluer or is forming stars more vigorously than the general Ðeld population. In fact, by all accounts in our analysis (color-magnitude, magnitude-radius, star formation rate, and Balmer-break amplitude), the host properties appear typical for faint blue Ðeld galaxies at comparable redshifts.},

abstract = {We report deep Chandra, HST and VLA observations of the binary neutron star event GW170817 at t 160 d after merger. These observations show that GW170817 has been steadily brightening with time and might have now reached its peak, and constrain the emission process as non-thermal synchrotron emission where the cooling frequency $\nu$c is above the X-ray band and the synchrotron frequency $\nu$m is below the radio band. The very simple power-law spectrum extending for eight orders of magnitude in frequency enables the most precise measurement of the index p of the distribution of non-thermal relativistic electrons N($\gamma$) ∝ $\gamma$− p accelerated by a shock launched by a NS-NS merger to date. We find p = 2.17 ± 0.01, which indicates that radiation from ejecta with $\Gamma$ - 3 − 10 dominates the observed emission. While constraining the nature of the emission process, these observations do not constrain the nature of the relativistic ejecta. We employ simulations of explosive outflows launched in NS ejecta clouds to show that the spectral and temporal evolution of the non-thermal emission from GW170817 is consistent with both emission from radially stratified quasi-spherical ejecta traveling at mildly relativistic speeds, and emission from off-axis collimated ejecta characterized by a narrow cone of ultra-relativistic material with slower wings extending to larger angles. In the latter scenario, GW170817 harbored a normal SGRB directed away from our line of sight. Observations at t ≤ 200 days are unlikely to settle the debate as in both scenarios the observed emission is effectively dominated by radiation from mildly relativistic material.},

abstract = {We present calculations of the wide angle emission of short-duration gamma-ray bursts from compact binary merger progenitors. Such events are expected to be localized by their gravi-tational wave emission, fairly irrespective of the orientation of the angular momentum vector of the system, along which the gamma-ray burst outflow is expected to propagate. We show that both the prompt and afterglow emission are dim and challenging to detect for observers lying outside the cone within which the relativistic outflow is propagating. If the jet initially propagates through a baryon contaminated region surrounding the merger site, however, a hot cocoon forms around it. The cocoon subsequently expands quasi-isotropically producing its own prompt emission and external shock powered afterglow. We show that the cocoon prompt emission is detectable by Swift BAT and Fermi GBM. We also show that the cocoon afterglow peaks a few hours to a few days after the burst and is detectable for up to a few weeks at all wavelengths. The timing and brightness of the transient are however uncertain due to their dependence on unknown quantities such as the density of the ambient medium surrounding the merger site, the cocoon energy and the cocoon Lorentz factor. For a significant fraction of the gravitationally detected neutron-star-binary mergers, the cocoon afterglow could possibly be the only identifiable electromagnetic counterpart, at least at radio and X-ray frequencies.},

abstract = {The accretion disc that forms after a neutron star merger is a source of neutron-rich ejecta. The ejected material contributes to a radioactively powered electromagnetic transient, with properties that depend sensitively on the composition of the outflow. Here, we investigate how the spin of the black hole (BH) remnant influences mass ejection on the thermal and viscous time-scales. We carry out two-dimensional, time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations of merger remnant accretion discs including viscous angular momentum transport and approximate neutrino self-irradiation. The gravity of the spinning BH is included via a pseudo-Newtonian potential. We find that a disc around a spinning BH ejects more mass, up to a factor of several, relative to the non-spinning case. The enhanced mass-loss is due to energy release by accretion occurring deeper in the gravitational potential, raising the disc temperature and hence the rate of viscous heating in regions where neutrino cooling is ineffective. The mean electron fraction of the outflow increases moderately with BH spin due to a highly irradiated (though not neutrino-driven) wind component. While the bulk of the ejecta is still very neutron-rich, thus generating heavy r-process elements, the leading edge of the wind contains a small amount of Lanthanide-free material. This component can give rise to an ≲1 d blue optical 'bump' in a kilonova light curve, even in the case of prompt BH formation, which may facilitate its detection.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The coalescence of double neutron star (NS–NS) and black hole (BH)–NS binaries are prime sources of gravitational waves (GW) for Advanced LIGO/Virgo and future ground-based detectors. Neutron-rich matter released from such events undergoes rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis as it decompresses into space, enriching our universe with rare heavy elements like gold and platinum. Radioactive decay of these unstable nuclei powers a rapidly evolving, approximately isotropic thermal transient known as a “kilonova”, which probes the physical conditions during the merger and its aftermath. Here I review the history and physics of kilonovae, leading to the current paradigm of day-timescale emission at optical wavelengths from lanthanide-free components of the ejecta, followed by week-long emission with a spectral peak in the near-infrared (NIR). These theoretical predictions, as compiled in the original version of this review, were largely confirmed by the transient optical/NIR counterpart discovered to the first NS–NS merger, GW170817, discovered by LIGO/Virgo. Using a simple light curve model to illustrate the essential physical processes and their application to GW170817, I then introduce important variations about the standard picture which may be observable in future mergers. These include ∼ hour-long UV precursor emission, powered by the decay of free neutrons in the outermost ejecta layers or shock-heating of the ejecta by a delayed ultra-relativistic outflow; and enhancement of the luminosity from a long-lived central engine, such as an accreting BH or millisecond magnetar. Joint GW and kilonova observations of GW170817 and future events provide a new avenue to constrain the astrophysical origin of the r-process elements and the equation of state of dense nuclear matter.},

We calculate the merger rates of NS–NS and NS–BH binaries from globular clusters (GCs) using realistic GC simulations with the CMC cluster catalog. We use a large sample of models with a range of initial numbers of stars, metallicities, virial radii and galactocentric distances, representative of the present-day Milky Way GCs, to quantify the inspiral times and volumetric merger rates as a function of redshift, both inside and ejected from clusters. We find that over the complete lifetime of most GCs, stellar BHs dominate the cluster cores and prevent the mass segregation of NSs, thereby reducing the dynamical interaction rates of NSs so that at most a few NS binary mergers are ever produced. We estimate the merger rate in the local universe to be ∼ 0.02 Gpc−3 yr−1 for both NS–NS and NS–BH binaries, or a total of ∼ 0.04 Gpc−3 yr−1 for both populations. These rates are about 5 orders of magnitude below the current empirical merger rate from LIGO/Virgo. We conclude that dynamical interactions in GCs do not play a significant role in enhancing the NS–NS and NS–BH merger rates.},

The text presents complete coverage of all the functionalities of BUGS, including prediction, missing data, model criticism, and prior sensitivity. It also features a large number of worked examples and a wide range of applications from various disciplines. The book introduces regression models, techniques for criticism and comparison, and a wide range of modelling issues before going into the vital area of hierarchical models, one of the most common applications of Bayesian methods. It deals with essentials of modelling without getting bogged down in complexity. The book emphasises model criticism, model comparison, sensitivity analysis to alternative priors, and thoughtful choice of prior distributions-all those aspects of the "art" of modelling that are easily overlooked in more theoretical expositions. More pragmatic than ideological, the authors systematically work through the large range of "tricks" that reveal the real power of the BUGS software, for example, dealing with missing data, censoring, grouped data, prediction, ranking, parameter constraints, and so on. Many of the examples are biostatistical, but they do not require domain knowledge and are generalisable to a wide range of other application areas.

For each equation of state, we vary the orbital properties around the threshold of the immediate merger, as well as the binary mass ratio. In addition to a study of the gravitational-wave emission including f-mode oscillations before and after the merger, we couple the dynamical ejecta output from the simulations to the nuclear-reaction network code skynet to compute nucleosynthetic yields and compare to the corresponding results in the case of a quasicircular merger. We find that the amount and velocity of dynamically ejected material are always much larger than in the quasicircular case, reaching maximal values of Mej,max∼0.1 M and vmax/c∼0.75. At the same time, the properties of this material are rather insensitive to the details of the orbit, such as the pericenter distance or postencounter apoastron distance. Furthermore, while the composition of the ejected matter depends on the orbital parameters and on the equation of state, the relative nucleosynthetic yields do not, thus indicating that kilonova signatures could provide information on the orbital properties of dynamically captured neutron-star binaries.},

abstract = {The neutron star merger, GW170817, was followed by an optical-infrared transient (a kilonova) which indicated that a substantial ejection of mass at trans-relativistic velocities occurred during the merger. Modelling of the kilonova is able to constrain the kinetic energy of the ejecta and its characteristic velocity but, not the high-velocity distribution of the ejecta. Yet, this distribution contains crucial information on the merger dynamics. In this work, we assume a power-law distribution of the form E({\textgreater} $\beta$$\Gamma$) ($\beta$$\Gamma$)-$\alpha$ for the energy of the kilonova ejecta and calculate the non-thermal signatures produced by the interaction of the ejecta with the ambient gas. We find that ejecta with minimum velocity $\beta$0 0.3 and energy E ∼1051 erg, as inferred from kilonova modelling, has a detectable radio, and possibly X-ray, afterglow for a broad range of parameter space. This afterglow component is expected to dominate the observed emission on a time-scale of a few years post-merger and peak around a decade later. Its light curve can be used to determine properties of the kilonova ejecta and, in particular, the ejecta velocity distribution $\alpha$, the minimum velocity $\beta$0, and its total kinetic energy E. We also predict that an afterglow rebrightening, that is associated with the kilonova component, will be accompanied by a shift of the centroid of the radio source towards the initial position of the explosion.},

abstract = {We present a systematic numerical relativity study of the mass ejection and the associated electromagnetic transients and nucleosynthesis from binary neutron star (NS) mergers. We find that a few 10−3 M⊙ of material are ejected dynamically during the mergers. The amount and the properties of these outflow depend on binary parameters and on the NS equation of state (EOS). A small fraction of these ejecta, typically ∼10−6 M⊙, is accelerated by shocks formed shortly after merger to velocities larger than 0.6 c and produces bright radio flares on timescales of weeks, months, or years after merger. Their observation could constrain the strength with which the NSs bounce after merger and, consequently, the EOS of matter at extreme densities. The dynamical ejecta robustly produce second and third r-process peak nuclei with relative isotopic abundances close to solar. The production of light r-process elements is instead sensitive to the binary mass ratio and the neutrino radiation treatment. Accretion disks of up to ∼0.2 M⊙ are formed after merger, depending on the lifetime of the remnant. In most cases, neutrino- and viscously-driven winds from these disks dominate the overall outflow. Finally, we generate synthetic kilonova light curves and find that kilonovae depend on the merger outcome and could be used to constrain the NS EOS.},

abstract = {We present optical and ultraviolet spectra of the first electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational wave (GW) source, the binary neutron star merger GW170817. Spectra were obtained nightly between 1.5 and 9.5 days post-merger, using the SOAR and Magellan telescopes; the UV spectrum was obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope at 5.5 days. Our data reveal a rapidly-fading blue component (T ≈ 5500K at 1.5 days) that quickly reddens; spectra later than {\&} 4.5 days peak beyond the optical regime. The spectra are mostly featureless, although we identify a possible weak emission line at ∼ 7900{\AA} at t ≲ 4.5 days. The colours, rapid evolution and featureless spectrum are consistent with a "blue" kilonova from polar ejecta comprised mainly of light r-process nuclei with atomic mass number A ≲ 140. This indicates a sight-line within $\theta$obs ≲ 45° of the orbital axis. Comparison to models suggests ∼ 0.03M⊙ of blue ejecta, with a velocity of ∼ 0.3c. The required lanthanide fraction is ∼10-4, but this drops to {\textless} 10-5in the outermost ejecta. The large velocities point to a dynamical origin, rather than a disk wind, for this blue component, suggesting that both binary constituents are neutron stars (as opposed to a binary consisting of a neutron star and a black hole). For dynamical ejecta, the high mass favors a small neutron star radius of ≲ 12 km. This mass also supports the idea that neutron star mergers are a major contributor to r-process nucleosynthesis.},

abstract = {We present a near-infrared spectral sequence of the electromagnetic counterpart to the binary neutron star merger GW170817 detected by Advanced LIGO/Virgo. Our dataset comprises 7 epochs of J + H spectra taken with FLAMINGOS-2 on Gemini-South between 1.5-10.5 days after the merger. In the initial epoch, the spectrum is dominated by a smooth blue continuum due to a high-velocity, lanthanide-poor blue kilonova component. Starting the following night, all subsequent spectra instead show features that are similar to those predicted in model spectra of material with a high concentration of lanthanides, including spectral peaks near 1.07 and 1.55 µm. Our fiducial model with 0.04 M☉ of ejecta, an ejection velocity of v = 0.1c, and a lanthanide concentration of Xlan=10−2 provides a good match to the spectra taken in the first five days, although it over-predicts the late-time fluxes. We also explore models with multiple fitting components, in each case finding that a significant abundance of lanthanide elements is necessary to match the broad spectral peaks that we observe starting at 2.5 d after the merger. These data provide direct evidence that binary neutron star mergers are significant production sites of even the heaviest r-process elements.},

abstract = {The detection of a kilo/macronova electromagnetic counterpart (AT2017gfo) of the first gravitational wave signal compatible with the merger of two neutron stars (GW170817) has confirmed the occurrence of r-process nucleosynthesis in this kind of events. The blue and red components of AT2017gfo have been interpreted as the signature of multi-component ejecta in the merger dynamics. However, the explanation of AT2017gfo in terms of the properties of the ejecta and of the ejection mechanisms is still incomplete. In this work, we analyse AT2017gfo with a new semi-analytic model of kilo/macronova inferred from general relativistic simulations of the merger and long-term numerical models of the merger aftermath. The model accounts for the anisotropic emission from the three known mass ejecta components: dynamic, winds and secular outflows from the disk. The early multi-band light-curves of AT2017gfo can only be explained by the presence of a relatively low opacity component of the ejecta at high latitudes. This points to the key role of weak interactions in setting the ejecta properties and determining the nucleosynthetic yields. Our model constrains also the total ejected mass associated to AT2017gfo to be between 0.042 and 0.077 M},

abstract = {We present UV, optical, and NIR photometry of the first electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational wave source from Advanced LIGO/Virgo, the binary neutron star merger GW170817. Our data set extends from the discovery of the optical counterpart at 0.47 days to 18.5 days post-merger, and includes observations with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), Gemini-South/FLAMINGOS-2 (GS/F2), and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The spectral energy distribution (SED) inferred from this photometry at 0.6 days is well described by a blackbody model with T ≈8300 K, a radius of R≈4.5×1014 cm (corresponding to an expansion velocity of v ≈ 0.3c), and a bolometric luminosity of Lbol ≈ 5 ×1041 erg s−1. At 1.5 days we find a multi-component SED across the optical and NIR, and subsequently we observe rapid fading in the UV and blue optical bands and significant reddening of the optical/NIR colors. Modeling the entire data set we find that models with heating from radioactive decay of 56Ni, or those with only a single component of opacity from r-process elements, fail to capture the rapid optical decline and red optical/NIR colors. Instead, models with two components consistent with lanthanide-poor and lanthanide-rich ejecta provide a good fit to the data; the resulting “blue” component has Mejblue ≈ 0.01 M☉ and vblueej ≈ 0.3c, and the “red” component has Mejred ≈ 0.04 M☉ and vredej ≈ 0.1c. These ejecta masses are broadly consistent with the estimated r-process production rate required to explain the Milky Way r-process abundances, providing the first evidence that BNS mergers can be a dominant site of r-process enrichment.},

abstract = {We present high-precision timing data over timespans of up to 11 years for 45 millisecond pulsars observed as part of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) project, aimed at detecting and characterizing low-frequency gravitational waves. The pulsars were observed with the Arecibo Observatory and/or the Green Bank Telescope at frequencies ranging from 327 MHz to 2.3 GHz. Most pulsars were observed with approximately monthly cadence, and six high-timing-precision pulsars were observed weekly. All were observed at widely separated frequencies at each observing epoch in order to fit for time-variable dispersion delays. We describe our methods for data processing, time-of-arrival (TOA) calculation, and the implementation of a new, automated method for removing outlier TOAs. We fit a timing model for each pulsar which includes spin, astrometric, and (for binary pulsars) orbital parameters; time-variable dispersion delays; and parameters that quantify pulse-profile evolution with frequency. The timing solutions provide three new parallax measurements, two new Shapiro delay measurements, and two new measurements of significant orbital-period variations. We fit models that characterize sources of noise for each pulsar. We find that 11 pulsars show significant red noise, with generally smaller spectral indices than typically measured for non-recycled pulsars, possibly suggesting a different origin. A companion paper uses these data to constrain the strength of the gravitational-wave background.},

We find that the data favor a broken power law to a pure power law with odds ratios of 22 and 2.2 to one for the McWilliams and Sesana prior models, respectively. The McWilliams model is essentially ruled out by the data, and the Sesana model is in tension with the data under the assumption of a pure power law. Using the broken power-law analysis we construct posterior distributions on environmental factors that drive the binary to the GW-driven regime including the stellar mass density for stellar-scattering, mass accretion rate for circumbinary disk interaction, and orbital eccentricity for eccentric binaries, marking the first time that the shape of the GWB spectrum has been used to make astrophysical inferences.

PBHs are formed soon after the enhanced scalar perturbations reenter horizon during the radiation dominated era, which would inevitably induce gravitational waves as well. Searching for such scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) provides an elegant way to probe PBHs. We perform the first direct search for the signals of SIGWs accompanying the formation of PBHs in the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational waves (NANOGrav) 11-year dataset. No statistically significant detection has been made, and hence we place a stringent upper limit on the abundance of PBHs at 95{\%} confidence level. In particular, less than one part in a million of the total DM mass could come from PBHs in the mass range of [2×10-3,7×10-1] MM.},

abstract = {Massive black hole binary systems, with masses in the range ∼10 4-1010 M⊙, are among the primary sources of gravitational waves in the frequency window ∼10-9-0.1 Hz. Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are the observational means by which we will be able to observe gravitational radiation from these systems. We carry out a systematic study of the generation of the stochastic gravitational-wave background from the cosmic population of massive black hole binaries. We consider a wide variety of assembly scenarios and we estimate the range of signal strength in the frequency band accessible to PTAs. We show that regardless of the specific model of massive black hole binaries formation and evolution, the characteristic amplitude hc of the gravitational-wave stochastic background at 10-8 Hz varies by less than a factor of 2. However, taking into account the uncertainties surrounding the actual key model parameters, the amplitude lies in the interval hc(f = 10-8 Hz) ≈ 5 × 10-16-8 × 10-15. The most optimistic predictions place the signal level at a factor of ≈3 below the current sensitivity of PTAs, but within the detection range of the complete Parkes PTA for a wide variety of models, and of the future Square-Kilometer Array PTA for all the models considered here. We also show that at frequencies ≳10-8 Hz, the frequency dependency of the generated background follows a power law significantly steeper than h c ∝ f-2/3, which has been considered so far; the value of the spectral index depends on the actual assembly scenario and provides therefore an additional opportunity to extract astrophysical information about the cosmic population of massive black holes. Finally, we show that LISA observations of individual resolvable massive black hole binaries are complementary and orthogonal to PTA observations of a stochastic background from the whole population in the Universe. In fact, the detection of gravitational radiation in both frequency windows will enable us to fully characterize the cosmic history of massive black holes. {\textcopyright} 2008 RAS.},

abstract = {We examine the light curves of two quasars, motivated by recent suggestions that a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) can exhibit sharp lensing spikes. We model the variability of each light curve as due to a combination of two relativistic effects: the orbital relativistic Doppler boost and gravitational binary self-lensing. In order to model each system we extend previous Doppler plus self-lensing models to include eccentricity. The first quasar is identified in optical data as a binary candidate with a 20-yr period (Ark 120), and shows a prominent spike. For this source, we rule out the lensing hypothesis, because if the observed sinusoid-like variability is attributed to Doppler shifts caused by the orbital motion, it would require a total BH mass in excess of 1012M☉. The second source, which we nickname Spikey, is the rare case of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) identified in Kepler's high-quality, high-cadence photometric data. For this source, we find a model, consisting of a combination of Doppler modulation and a narrow symmetric lensing spike, consistent with an eccentric SMBH binary with mass Mtot = 5.4×107M☉, rest-frame orbital period T = 422 days, eccentricity e = 0.6, and seen at an inclination 9◦ from edge-on. This interpretation can be tested by monitoring Spikey for periodic behavior and recurring flares in the next few years. In preparation for such monitoring we present the first X-ray observations of this object taken by the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory.},

abstract = {On 2017 August 17 a binary neutron star coalescence candidate (later designated GW170817) with merger time 12:41:04 UTC was observed through gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of ∼1.7 s with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg2at a luminosity distance of 40+8-8Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 M⊙. An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at ∼40 Mpc) less than 11 hours after the merger by the One-Meter, Two Hemisphere (1M2H) team using the 1 m Swope Telescope. The optical transient was independently detected by multiple teams within an hour. Subsequent observations targeted the object and its environment. Early ultraviolet observations revealed a blue transient that faded within 48 hours. Optical and infrared observations showed a redward evolution over ∼10 days. Following early non-detections, X-ray and radio emission were discovered at the transient's position ∼9 and ∼16 days, respectively, after the merger. Both the X-ray and radio emission likely arise from a physical process that is distinct from the one that generates the UV/optical/near-infrared emission. No ultra-high-energy gamma-rays and no neutrino candidates consistent with the source were found in follow-up searches. These observations support the hypothesis that GW170817 was produced by the merger of two neutron stars in NGC4993 followed by a short gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) and a kilonova/macronova powered by the radioactive decay of r-process nuclei synthesized in the ejecta.},

We overview the observational evidence supporting this scenario including: the total amount of r-process elements in the galaxy, extreme metal-poor stars, geological radioactive elemental abundances, dwarf galaxies and short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). Recently, the advanced LIGO and Virgo observatories discovered a gravitational-wave signal of a neutron star merger, GW170817, as well as accompanying multi-wavelength electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. The ultra-violet, optical and near infrared (n/R) observations point to r-process elements that have been synthesized in the merger ejecta. The rate and ejected mass inferred from GW170817 and the EM counterparts are consistent with other observations. We however, find that, within the simple one zone chemical evolution models (based on merger rates with reasonable delay time distributions as expected from evolutionary models, or from observations of sGRBs), it is difficult to reconcile the current observations of the Eu abundance history of galactic stars for [Fe/H] ≥-1. This implies that to account for the role of mergers in the galactic chemical evolution, we need a galactic model with multiple populations that have different spatial distributions and/or varying formation rates.},

Here, we show that PTAs are also sensitive to mergers of supermassive black holes. While these mergers occur on a time-scale too short to be resolvable by a PTA, they generate a change of metric due to non-linear gravitational-wave memory which persists for the duration of the experiment and could be detected. We develop the theory of the single-source detection by PTAs, and derive the sensitivity of PTAs to the gravitational-wave memory jumps. We show that mergers of 10 8 M⊙ black holes are 2 - $\sigma$-detectable (in a direction-, polarization- and time-dependent way) out to comoving distances of ∼1 billion light-years. Modern prediction for black hole merger rates imply marginal to modest chance of an individual jump detection by currently developed PTAs.

abstract = {Growing evidence connects the progenitor systems of the short-hard subclass of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to the merger of compact object binaries composed of two neutron stars (NSs) or of an NS and a black hole (BH). The recent observation of the binary NS (BNS) merger event GW170817 associated with GRB 170817A brought a great deal of additional information and provided further support to the above connection, even though the identification of this burst as a canonical short GRB (SGRB) remains uncertain. Decades of observational constraints and theoretical models consolidated the idea of a jet origin for the GRB prompt emission, which can also explain the multiwavelength afterglow radiation observed in most of the events. However, the mechanisms through which a BNS or NS-BH merger remnant would power a collimated outflow are much less constrained. Understanding the properties of the remnant systems and whether they can provide the right conditions for jet production has been a main driver of the great effort devoted to study BNS and NS-BH mergers, and still represents a real challenge from both the physical and the computational points of view. One fundamental open question concerns the nature of the central engine itself. While the leading candidate system is a BH surrounded by a massive accretion disk, the recent observation of plateau-shaped X-ray afterglows in some SGRBs would suggest a longer-lived engine, i.e. a metastable (or even stable) massive NS, which would also exclude NS-BH progenitors. Here we elaborate on this key aspect, considering three different scenarios to explain the SGRB phenomenology based on different hypotheses on the nature of the merger remnant. Then, we discuss the basic properties of GRB 170817A and how this event would fit within the different frameworks of the above scenarios, under the assumption that it was or was not a canonical SGRB.},

abstract = {Using a two-dimensional hydrodynamics code (PROMETHEUS), we explore the continued evolution of rotating helium stars, M$\alpha${\textgreater}{\~{}}10 Msolar, in which iron-core collapse does not produce a successful outgoing shock but instead forms a black hole of 2-3 Msolar. The model explored in greatest detail is the 14 Msolar helium core of a 35 Msolar main-sequence star. The outcome is sensitive to the angular momentum. For j16≡j/(1016 cm2 s-1){\textless}{\~{}}3, material falls into the black hole almost uninhibited. No outflows are expected. For j16{\textgreater}{\~{}}20, the infalling matter is halted by centrifugal force outside 1000 km where neutrino losses are negligible. The equatorial accretion rate is very low, and explosive oxygen burning may power a weak equatorial explosion. For 3{\textless}{\~{}}j16{\textless}{\~{}}20, however, a reasonable value for such stars, a compact disk forms at a radius at which the gravitational binding energy can be efficiently radiated as neutrinos or converted to beamed outflow by magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) processes. These are the best candidates for producing gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Here we study the formation of such a disk, the associated flow patterns, and the accretion rate for disk viscosity parameter $\alpha${\~{}}0.001 and 0.1. Infall along the rotational axis is initially uninhibited, and an evacuated channel opens during the first few seconds. Meanwhile the black hole is spun up by the accretion (to a{\~{}}0.9), and energy is dissipated in the disk by MHD processes and radiated by neutrinos. For the $\alpha$=0.1 model, appreciable energetic outflows develop between polar angles of 30° and 45°. These outflows, powered by viscous dissipation in the disk, have an energy of up to a few times 1051 ergs and a mass {\~{}}1 Msolar and are rich in 56Ni. They constitute a supernova-like explosion by themselves. Meanwhile accretion through the disk is maintained for approximately 10-20 s but is time variable (+/-30{\%}) because of hydrodynamical instabilities at the outer edge in a region where nuclei are experiencing photodisintegration. Because the efficiency of neutrino energy deposition is sensitive to the accretion rate, this instability leads to highly variable energy deposition in the polar regions. Some of this variability, which has significant power at 50 ms and overtones, may persist in the time structure of the burst. During the time followed, the average accretion rate for the standard $\alpha$=0.1 and j16=10 model is 0.07 Msolar s-1. The total energy deposited along the rotational axes by neutrino annihilation is (1-14)×1051 ergs, depending upon the evolution of the Kerr parameter and uncertain neutrino efficiencies. Simulated deposition of energy in the polar regions, at a constant rate of 5×1050 ergs s-1 per pole, results in strong relativistic outflow jets beamed to about 1{\%} of the sky. These jets may be additionally modulated by instabilities in the sides of the ``nozzle'' through which they flow. The jets blow aside the accreting material, remain highly focused, and are capable of penetrating the star in {\~{}}10 s. After the jet breaks through the surface of the star, highly relativistic flow can emerge. Because of the sensitivity of the mass ejection and jets to accretion rate, angular momentum, and disk viscosity, and the variation of observational consequences with viewing angle, a large range of outcomes is possible, ranging from bright GRBs like GRB 971214 to faint GRB-supernovae like SN 1998bw. X-ray precursors are also possible as the jet first breaks out of the star. While only a small fraction of supernovae make GRBs, we predict that collapsars will always make supernovae similar to SN 1998bw. However, hard, energetic GRBs shorter than a few seconds will be difficult to produce in this model and may require merging neutron stars and black holes for their explanation.},

Here we present analyses of the noise contributions to pulsar timing residuals from continuous multi-hour observations of seven millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We present scintillation bandwidth measurements for all MSPs in the sample, some for the first time, and scintillation timescale measurements and lower limits for all MSPs for the first time. In addition, we present upper limits on the contribution of pulse phase jitter to the timing residual error for all MSPs. These long observations also allow us to constrain variations in dispersion measures (DMs) on hour-long timescales for several millisecond pulsars. We find that there are no apparent DM variations in any of the MSPs studied on these timescales as expected. In light of new radio telescopes such as the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), which will be able to time many pulsars for a short time each day, we search for differences in timing precisions from continuous TOAs and from equivalent length time-discontinuous TOAs. We find no differences in the precision for any MSP in our sample, as expected. We conclude that the TOA variations are consistent with the expected breakdown into template-fitting, jitter, and scintillation errors.},

abstract = {We present a statistically robust mass-metallicity relation for long-duration gamma-ray burst (LGRB) host galaxies at z {\textless} 1. By comparing the LGRB host mass-metallicity relation to samples representative of the general starforming galaxy population, we conclude that LGRBs occur in host galaxies with lower metallicities than the general population, and that this trend extends to z ∼ 1, with an average offset of -0.42 ± 0.18 from the M-Z relation for star-forming galaxies. Our sample in this work includes new spectroscopic data for six LGRB host galaxies obtained at the Keck and Magellan telescopes, as well as two new host galaxies from the literature. Combined with data from our previous work, this yields a total sample of six LGRB host galaxies at z {\textless} 0.3 and 10 host galaxies at 0.3 {\textless} z {\textless} 1. We have determined a number of interstellar medium properties for our host galaxies using optical emission-line diagnostics including metallicity, ionization parameter, young stellar population age, and star formation rate. Across our full sample of 16 LGRB hosts we find an average metallicity of log(O/H) + 12 = 8.4 ± 0.3. Notably, we also measure a comparatively high metallicity of log(O/H) + 12 = 8.83 ± 0.1 for the z = 0.296 host galaxy of GRB 050826. We also determine stellar masses (M*) for our LGRB host galaxy sample, finding a mean stellar mass of log(M*/M⊙) = 9.25 -0.23+0.19. {\textcopyright} 2010. The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {Unusually high velocities ({\&} 0.1c) and correspondingly high kinetic energies have been observed in a subset of Type Ic supernovae (so-called “broad-lined Ic” supernovae; SNe Ic-BL), prompting a search for a central engine model capable of generating such energetic explosions. A clue to the explosion mechanism may lie in the fact that all supernovae that accompany long-duration gamma-ray bursts belong to the SN Ic-BL class. Using a combination of two-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamics and radiation transport calculations, we demonstrate that the central engine responsible for long gamma-ray bursts can also trigger a SN Ic-BL. We find that a reasonable gamma-ray burst engine injected into a stripped Wolf-Rayet progenitor produces a relativistic jet with energy ∼1051 ergs, as well as a SN whose synthetic light curves and spectra are fully consistent with observed SNe Ic-BL during the photospheric phase. As a result of the jet's asymmetric energy injection, the SN spectra and light curves depend on viewing angle. The impact of viewing angle on the spectrum is particularly pronounced at early times, while the viewing angle dependence for the light curves (∼10 {\%} variation in bolometric luminosity) persists throughout the photospheric phase.},

abstract = {When the afterglow fades at the site of a long-duration gamma-ray burst (LGRB), Type Ic supernovae (SN Ic) are the only type of core collapse supernova observed. Recent work found that a sample of LGRB in high-redshift galaxies had different environments from a collection of core-collapse environments, which were identified from their colors and light curves. LGRB were in the brightest regions of their hosts, but the core-collapse sample followed the overall distribution of the galaxy light. Here we examine 504 supernovae with types assigned based on their spectra that are located in nearby (z {\textless} 0.06) galaxies for which we have constructed surface photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The distributions of the thermonuclear supernovae (SN Ia) and some varieties of core-collapse supernovae (SN II and SN Ib) follow the galaxy light, but the SN Ic (like LGRB) are much more likely to erupt in the brightest regions of their hosts. The high-redshift hosts of LGRB are overwhelmingly irregulars, without bulges, while many low redshift SN Ic hosts are spirals with small bulges. When we remove the bulge light from our low-redshift sample, the SN Ic and LGRB distributions agree extremely well. If both LGRB and SN Ic stem from very massive stars, then it seems plausible that the conditions necessary for forming SN Ic are also required for LGRB. Additional factors, including metallicity, may determine whether the stellar evolution of a massive star leads to a LGRB with an underlying broad-lined SN Ic, or simply a SN Ic without a gamma-ray burst.},

abstract = {When massive stars exhaust their fuel, they collapse and often produce the extraordinarily bright explosions known as core-collapse supernovae. On occasion, this stellar collapse also powers an even more brilliant relativistic explosion known as a long-duration $\gamma$-ray burst. One would then expect that these long $\gamma$-ray bursts and core-collapse supernovae should be found in similar galactic environments. Here we show that this expectation is wrong. We find that the $\gamma$-ray bursts are far more concentrated in the very brightest regions of their host galaxies than are the core-collapse supernovae. Furthermore, the host galaxies of the long $\gamma$-ray bursts are significantly fainter and more irregular than the hosts of the core-collapse supernovae. Together these results suggest that long-duration $\gamma$-ray bursts are associated with the most extremely massive stars and may be restricted to galaxies of limited chemical evolution. Our results directly imply that long $\gamma$-ray bursts are relatively rare in galaxies such as our own Milky Way. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {We present the results of numerical simulations of the prompt emission of short-duration gamma-ray bursts. We consider emission from the relativistic jet, the mildly relativistic cocoon, and the non-relativistic shocked ambient material. We find that the cocoon material is confined between off-axis angles 15 ≲ $\theta$ ≲ 45◦ and gives origin to X-ray transients with a duration of a few to ∼ 10 seconds, delayed by a few seconds from the time of the merger. We also discuss the distance at which such transients can be detected, finding that it depends sensitively on the assumptions that are made about the radiation spectrum. Purely thermal cocoon transients are detectable only out to a few Mpc, Comptonized transients can instead be detected by the FERMI GBM out to several tens of Mpc.},

abstract = {We present the results from three gravitational-wave searches for coalescing compact binaries with component masses above 1 Ma™ during the first and second observing runs of the advanced gravitational-wave detector network. During the first observing run (O1), from September 12, 2015 to January 19, 2016, gravitational waves from three binary black hole mergers were detected. The second observing run (O2), which ran from November 30, 2016 to August 25, 2017, saw the first detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star inspiral, in addition to the observation of gravitational waves from a total of seven binary black hole mergers, four of which we report here for the first time: GW170729, GW170809, GW170818, and GW170823. For all significant gravitational-wave events, we provide estimates of the source properties. The detected binary black holes have total masses between 18.6-0.7+3.2 M{\^{a}}™ and 84.4-11.1+15.8 M{\^{a}}™ and range in distance between 320-110+120 and 2840-1360+1400 Mpc. No neutron star-black hole mergers were detected. In addition to highly significant gravitational-wave events, we also provide a list of marginal event candidates with an estimated false-alarm rate less than 1 per 30 days. From these results over the first two observing runs, which include approximately one gravitational-wave detection per 15 days of data searched, we infer merger rates at the 90{\%} confidence intervals of 110-3840 Gpc-3 y-1 for binary neutron stars and 9.7-101 Gpc-3 y-1 for binary black holes assuming fixed population distributions and determine a neutron star-black hole merger rate 90{\%} upper limit of 610 Gpc-3 y-1.},

abstract = {A general method, suitable for fast computing machines, for investigating such properties as equations of state for substances consisting of interacting individual molecules is described. The method consists of a modified Monte Carlo integration over configuration space. Results for the two-dimensional rigid-sphere system have been obtained on the Los Alamos MANIAC and are presented here. These results are compared to the free volume equation of state and to a four-term virial coefficient expansion.},

abstract = {Early studies of the time histories of the y-ray burst events reported by the Vela satellites led to the suggestion that very brief, - 0.1 s, bursts formed a class distinct from the longer, highly structured bursts!. Results of the KONUS experiments on Veneras 11, 12. 13 and 14 argue for the existence of a separate class of short-duration y-ray burstsZ , revealing that many of the short bursts exhibit much softer spectra ( - 30 ke V) than the more familiar complex bursts. Although this correlation is not completely clear and the observations are in some cases contradictory:H{\textgreater}, the existence of two y-ray burst populations is suggested by Fig. 1, showing a duration histogram for 24 events detected by our ISEE-3 experiment. Figure 1 also shows the distribution of 123 Venera 13 and 14 events (60 detected by both spacecraft) and suggests two y-ray burst populations in each experiment sample. the domains separated with a minimum near 1 or 2 s. Here we point out that the results of the Goddard ISEE-3 y-ray burst spectrometer actually enhance the appearance of two burst populations suggested in the Venera data.},

@article{Abbott2017a,
abstract = {On August 17, 2017 at 12-41:04 UTC the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors made their first observation of a binary neutron star inspiral. The signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one per 8.0×104 years. We infer the component masses of the binary to be between 0.86 and 2.26 M, in agreement with masses of known neutron stars. Restricting the component spins to the range inferred in binary neutron stars, we find the component masses to be in the range 1.17-1.60 M, with the total mass of the system 2.74-0.01+0.04M. The source was localized within a sky region of 28 deg2 (90{\%} probability) and had a luminosity distance of 40-14+8 Mpc, the closest and most precisely localized gravitational-wave signal yet. The association with the $\gamma$-ray burst GRB 170817A, detected by Fermi-GBM 1.7 s after the coalescence, corroborates the hypothesis of a neutron star merger and provides the first direct evidence of a link between these mergers and short $\gamma$-ray bursts. Subsequent identification of transient counterparts across the electromagnetic spectrum in the same location further supports the interpretation of this event as a neutron star merger. This unprecedented joint gravitational and electromagnetic observation provides insight into astrophysics, dense matter, gravitation, and cosmology.},

abstract = {The main hard pulse of prompt gamma-ray emission in GRB 170817A had a duration of ∼ 0.5 s and its onset was delayed with respect to the gravitational-wave chirp signal by tdel ≈ 1.74 s. Detailed follow-up of the subsequent broadband kilonova emission revealed a two-component ejecta - a lanthanide-poor ejecta with mass Mej,blue ≈ 0.025 M☉ that powered the early but rapidly fading blue emission and a lanthanide-rich ejecta with mass Mej,red ≈ 0.04 M☉ that powered the longer lasting redder emission. Both the prompt gamma-ray onset delay and the existence of the blue ejecta with modest electron fraction, 0.2 . Ye . 0.3, can be explained if the collapse to a black hole was delayed by the formation of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). Here, we determine the survival time of the merger remnant by combining two different constraints, namely, the time needed to produce the requisite blue-ejecta mass and that necessary for the relativistic jet to bore its way out of the expanding ejecta. In this way, we determine that the remnant of GW170817 must have collapsed to a black hole after tcoll = 0.98−+00..3126 s. We also discuss how future detections and the delays between the gravitational and electromagnetic emissions can be used to constrain the properties of the merged object.},

Phys. 21, 1087 (1953)] marked the beginning of the use of the Monte Carlo method for solving problems in the physical sciences. The method described in this publication subsequently became known as the Metropolis algorithm, undoubtedly the most famous and most widely used Monte Carlo algorithm ever published. As none of the authors made subsequent use of the algorithm, they became unknown to the large simulation physics community that grew from this publication and their roles in its development became the subject of mystery and legend. At a conference marking the 50th anniversary of the 1953 publication, Marshall Rosenbluth gave his recollections of the algorithm's development. The present paper describes the algorithm, reconstructs the historical context in which it was developed, and summarizes Marshall's recollections. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Merging neutron stars offer an excellent laboratory for simultaneously studying strong-field gravity and matter in extreme environments. We establish the physical association of an electromagnetic counterpart (EM170817) with gravitational waves (GW170817) detected from merging neutron stars. By synthesizing a panchromatic data set, we demonstrate that merging neutron stars are a long-sought production site forging heavy elements by r-process nucleosynthesis. The weak gamma rays seen in EM170817 are dissimilar to classical short gamma-ray bursts with ultrarelativistic jets. Instead, we suggest that breakout of a wide-angle, mildly relativistic cocoon engulfing the jet explains the low-luminosity gamma rays, the high-luminosity ultraviolet-optical-infrared, and the delayed radio and x-ray emission. We posit that all neutron star mergers may lead to a wide-angle cocoon breakout, sometimes accompanied by a successful jet and sometimes by a choked jet.},

abstract = {We use gravitational-wave observations of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 to explore the tidal deformabilities and radii of neutron stars. We perform a Bayesian parameter estimation with the source location and distance informed by electromagnetic observations. We also assume that the two stars have the same equation of state; we demonstrate that, for stars with masses comparable to the component masses of GW170817, this is effectively implemented by assuming that the stars' dimensionless tidal deformabilities are determined by the binary's mass ratio q by $\Lambda$1/$\Lambda$2=q6. We investigate different choices of prior on the component masses of the neutron stars. We find that the tidal deformability and 90{\%} credible interval is $\Lambda$=222-138+420 for a uniform component mass prior, $\Lambda$=245-151+453 for a component mass prior informed by radio observations of Galactic double neutron stars, and $\Lambda$=233-144+448 for a component mass prior informed by radio pulsars. We find a robust measurement of the common areal radius of the neutron stars across all mass priors of 8.9 13.2 km, with a mean value of =10.8 km. Our results are the first measurement of tidal deformability with a physical constraint on the star's equation of state and place the first lower bounds on the deformability and areal radii of neutron stars using gravitational waves.},

The astrophysical consequences of a hadron-quark phase transition in the interior of a compact star will be focused within this article. Especially with a future detection of the post-merger gravitational wave emission emanated from a binary neutron star merger event, it would be possible to explore the phase structure of quantum chromodynamics. The astrophysical observables of a hadron-quark phase transition in a single compact star system and binary hybrid star merger scenario will be summarized within this article. The FAIR facility at GSI Helmholtzzentrum allows one to study the universe in the laboratory, and several astrophysical signatures of the quark-gluon plasma have been found in relativistic collisions of heavy ions and will be explored in future experiments.},

abstract = {We show that the delay between GRB170817A and GW170817 is incompatible with de-beamed emission from an off-axis relativistic jet. The prompt emission and the subsequent radio and X-ray observations can instead be interpreted within a giant-flare-like scenario, being the result of a relativistic outflow driven by the ultra-strong magnetic field produced by magnetohydrodynamic amplification during the merger of the progenitor double neutron-star binary. Within such a picture, the data indicate that the outflow must be endowed with a steep velocity profile, with a relatively fast tail extending to $\Gamma$ ∼ 8. Since the conditions for the launch of such an outflow are relatively general, and the presence of a velocity profile is a natural expectation of the acceleration process, most neutron star binary mergers should feature this quasi-isotropic, hard X-ray emission component, that could be a powerful guide to the discovery of additional kilonovae associated to relatively nearby gravitational wave events.},

abstract = {The binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 was the first astrophysical source detected in gravitational waves and multiwavelength electromagnetic radiation. The almost simultaneous observation of a pulse of gamma rays proved that BNS mergers are associated with at least some short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, the gamma-ray pulse was faint, casting doubt on the association of BNS mergers with the luminous, highly relativistic outflows of canonical short GRBs. Here we show that structured jets with a relativistic, energetic core surrounded by slower and less energetic wings produce afterglow emission that brightens characteristically with time, as recently seen in the afterglow of GW170817. Initially, we only see the relatively slow material moving towards us. As time passes, larger and larger sections of the outflow become visible, increasing the luminosity of the afterglow. The late appearance and increasing brightness of the multiwavelength afterglow of GW170817 allow us to constrain the geometry of its ejecta and thus reveal the presence of an off-axis jet pointing about 30° away from Earth. Our results confirm a single origin for BNS mergers and short GRBs: GW170817 produced a structured outflow with a highly relativistic core and a canonical short GRB. We did not see the bright burst because it was beamed away from Earth. However, approximately one in 20 mergers detected in gravitational waves will be accompanied by a bright, canonical short GRB.},

abstract = {GRB 170817A was a subluminous short gamma-ray burst detected about 1.74 s after the gravitational wave signal GW170817 from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger. It is now understood as an off-axis event powered by the cocoon of a relativistic jet pointing 15 to 30 degrees away from the direction of observation. The cocoon was energized by the interaction of the incipient jet with the non-relativistic baryon wind from the merger remnant, resulting in a structured outflow with a narrow core and broad wings. In this paper, we couple the observational constraints on the structured outflow with a model for the jet-wind interaction to constrain the intrinsic properties with which the jet was launched by the central engine, including its time delay from the merger event. Using wind prescriptions inspired by magnetized BNS merger simulations, we find that the jet was launched within about 0.4 s from the merger, implying that the 1.74 s observed delay was dominated by the fireball propagation up to the photospheric radius. We also constrain, for the first time for any gamma-ray burst, the jet opening angle at injection and set a lower limit to its asymptotic Lorentz factor. These findings suggest an initially Poynting-flux dominated jet, launched via electromagnetic processes. If the jet was powered by an accreting black hole, they also provide a significant constraint on the survival time of the metastable neutron star remnant.},

abstract = {We present a revised and complete optical afterglow light curve of the binary neutron star merger GW170817, enabled by deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) F606W observations at ≈584 days post-merger, which provide a robust optical template. The light curve spans ≈ 110 − 362 days, and is fully consistent with emission from a relativistic structured jet viewed off-axis, as previously indicated by radio and X-ray data. Combined with contemporaneous radio and X-ray observations, we find no spectral evolution, with a weighted average spectral index of h$\beta$i = −0.583 ± 0.013, demonstrating that no synchrotron break frequencies evolve between the radio and X-ray bands over these timescales. We find that an extrapolation of the post-peak temporal slope of GW170817 to the luminosities of cosmological short GRBs matches their observed jet break times, suggesting that their explosion properties are similar, and that the primary difference in GW170817 is viewing angle. Additionally, we place a deep limit on the luminosity and mass of an underlying globular cluster of L . 6.7 ×103 Lⵙ, or M . 1.3 × 104 Mⵙ, at least 4 standard deviations below the peak of the globular cluster mass function of the host galaxy, NGC4993. This limit provides a direct and strong constraint that GW170817 did not form and merge in a globular cluster.

In a total exposure of 96.6 ks, performed between 2020 March 9 and 16 (935-942 d after the merger), a total of 8 photons are measured at the source position, corresponding to a significance of ≈5$\sigma$. Radio monitoring with the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) shows instead that the source has faded below our detection threshold ({\textless}33 $\mu$Jy, 3$\sigma$). By assuming a constant spectral index of $\beta$ = 0.585, we derive an unabsorbed X-ray flux of ≈1.4 × 10−15 erg cm−2 s−1, higher than earlier predictions, yet still consistent with a simple structured jet model. We discuss possible scenarios that could account for prolonged emission in X-rays. The current data set appears consistent both with energy injection by a long-lived central engine and with the onset of a kilonova afterglow, arising from the interaction of the sub-relativistic merger ejecta with the surrounding medium. Long-term monitoring of this source will be essential to test these different models.},

abstract = {The first gravitational wave (GW) — gamma-ray burst (GRB) association, GW170817/GRB 170817A, had an offset in time, with the GRB trigger time delayed by ∼1.7 s with respect to the merger time of the GW signal. We generally discuss the astrophysical origin of the delay time, $\Delta$t, of GW-GRB associations within the context of compact binary coalescence (CBC) — short GRB (sGRB) associations and GW burst — long GRB (lGRB) associations. In general, the delay time should include three terms, the time to launch a clean (relativistic) jet, $\Delta$tjet; the time for the jet to break out from the surrounding medium, $\Delta$tbo; and the time for the jet to reach the energy dissipation and GRB emission site, $\Delta$tGRB. For CBC-sGRB associations, $\Delta$tjet and $\Delta$tbo are correlated, and the final delay can be from 10 ms to a few seconds. For GWB-lGRB associations, $\Delta$tjet and $\Delta$tbo are independent. The latter is at least ∼10 s, so that $\Delta$t of these associations is at least this long. For certain jet launching mechanisms of lGRBs, $\Delta$t can be minutes or even hours long due to the extended engine waiting time to launch a jet. We discuss the cases of GW170817/GRB 170817A and GW150914/GW150914-GBM within this theoretical framework and suggest that the delay times of future GW/GRB associations will shed light into the jet launching mechanisms of GRBs.},

abstract = {Double neutron star (DNS) merger events are promising candidates of short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) progenitors as well as high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) emitters. On August 17, 2017, such a coinciding event was detected by both the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave detector network as GW170817 and Gamma-Ray Monitor on board NASA's Fermi Space Telescope as GRB 170817A. Here, we show that the fluence and spectral peak energy of this sGRB fall into the lower portion of the distributions of known sGRBs. Its peak isotropic luminosity is abnormally low. The estimated event rate density above this luminosity is at least 190-160+ 440 Gpc-3 yr-1, which is close to but still below the DNS merger event rate density. This event likely originates from a structured jet viewed from a large viewing angle. There are similar faint soft GRBs in the Fermi archival data, a small fraction of which might belong to this new population of nearby, low-luminosity sGRBs.},

abstract = {We report our observation of the short gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 170817A, associated to the binary neutron star merger gravitational wave (GW) event GW 170817, performed in the X-ray band with XMM-Newton 135 d after the event (on 29 December, 2017). We find evidence for a flattening of the X-ray light curve with respect to the previously observed brightening. This is also supported by a nearly simultaneous optical Hubble Space Telescope observation and successive X-ray Chandra and low-frequency radio observations recently reported in the literature. Since the optical-to-X-ray spectral slope did not change with respect to previous observations, we exclude that the change in the temporal evolution of the light curve is due to the passage of the cooling frequency: its origin must be geometric or dynamical. We interpret all the existing afterglow data with two models: i) a structured jet and ii) a jet-less isotropic fireball with some stratification in its radial velocity structure. Both models fit the data and predict that the radio flux must decrease simultaneously with the optical and X-ray emission, making it difficult to distinguish between them at the present stage. Polarimetric measurements and the rate of short GRB-GW associations in future LIGO/Virgo runs will be key to disentangle these two geometrically different scenarios.},

The significance of association between the gamma-ray burst observed by INTEGRAL and GW170817 is 3.2 $\sigma$, while the association between the Fermi-GBM and INTEGRAL detections is 4.2 $\sigma$. GRB 170817A was detected by the SPI-ACS instrument about 2 s after the end of the gravitational wave event. We measure a fluence of (1.4±0.4±0.6)×10-7erg cm-2) (75-2000 keV), where, respectively, the statistical error is given at the 1 $\sigma$ confidence level, and the systematic error corresponds to the uncertainty in the spectral model and instrument response. We also report on the pointed follow-up observations carried out by INTEGRAL, starting 19.5 h after the event, and lasting for 5.4 days. We provide a stringent upper limit on any electromagnetic signal in a very broad energy range, from 3 keV to 8 MeV, constraining the soft gamma-ray afterglow flux to {\textless} 7.1×10-11 erg cm-2s-1(80-300 keV). Exploiting the unique capabilities of INTEGRAL, we constrained the gamma-ray line emission from radioactive decays that are expected to be the principal source of the energy behind a kilonova event following a BNS coalescence. Finally, we put a stringent upper limit on any delayed bursting activity, for example from a newly formed magnetar.},

The LAT was entering the South Atlantic Anomaly at the time of the LIGO/Virgo trigger (tGW) and therefore cannot place constraints on the existence of high-energy (E {\textgreater} 100 MeV) emission associated with the moment of binary coalescence. We focus instead on constraining high-energy emission on longer timescales. No candidate electromagnetic counterpart was detected by the LAT on timescales of minutes, hours, or days after the LIGO/Virgo detection. The resulting flux upper bound (at 95{\%} C.L.) from the LAT is 4.5×10−10 erg cm−2 s−1 in the 0.1–1 GeV range covering a period from tGW + 1153 s to tGW + 2027 s. At the distance of GRB 170817A, this flux upper bound corresponds to a luminosity upper bound of 9.7×1043 erg s−1, which is 5 orders of magnitude less luminous than the only other LAT SGRB with known redshift, GRB 090510.

abstract = {The joint detection of gravitational waves (GWs) and $\gamma$-rays from a binary neutron star (NS) merger provided a unique view of off-axis gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and an independent measurement of the NS merger rate. Comparing the observations of GRB170817 with those of the regular population of short GRBs (sGRBs), we show that an order unity fraction of NS mergers result in sGRB jets that breakout of the surrounding ejecta. We argue that the luminosity function of sGRBs, peaking at ≈2 × 1052 erg s−1, is likely an intrinsic property of the sGRB central engine and that sGRB jets are typically narrow with opening angles $\theta$0 ≈ 0.1. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to examine models for the structure and efficiency of the prompt emission in off-axis sGRBs. We find that only a small fraction (∼0.01-0.1) of NS mergers detectable by LIGO/VIRGO in GWs is expected to be also detected in prompt $\gamma$-rays and that GW170817-like events are very rare. For an NS merger rate of ∼1500 Gpc−3 yr−1, as inferred from GW170817, we expect within the next decade up to ∼12 joint detections with off-axis GRBs for structured-jet models and just ∼1 for quasi-spherical cocoon models where $\gamma$-rays are the result of shock breakout. Given several joint detections and the rates of their discoveries, the different structure models can be distinguished. In addition the existence of a cocoon with a reservoir of thermal energy may be observed directly in the ultraviolet, given a sufficiently rapid localization of the GW source.},

abstract = {The matter in neutron stars is essentially in its ground state and ranges in density up to and beyond 3 × 1014 g/cm3, the density of nuclear matter. Here we determine the constitution of the ground state of matter and its equation of state in the regime from 4.3 × 1011 g/cm3 where free neutrons begin to "drip" out of the nuclei, up to densities ≈ 5 × 1014 g/cm3, where standard nuclear-matter theory is still reliable. We describe the energy of nuclei in the free neutron regime by a compressible liquid-drop model designed to take into account three important features: (i) as the density increases, the bulk nuclear matter inside the nuclei, and the pure neutron gas outside the nuclei become more and more alike; (ii) the presence of the neutron gas reduces the nuclear surface energy; and (iii) the Coulomb interaction between nuclei, which keeps the nuclei in a lattice, becomes significant as the spacing between nuclei becomes comparable to the nuclear radius. We find that nuclei survive in the matter up to a density ∼ 2.4 × 1014 g/cm3; below this point we find no tendency for the protons to leave the nuclei. The transition between the phase with nuclei and the liquid phase at higher densities occurs as follows. The nuclei grow in size until they begin to touch; the remaining density inhomogeneity smooths out with increasing density until it disappears at about 3 × 1014 g/cm3 in a first-order transition. It is shown that the uniform liquid is unstable against density fluctuations below this density; the wave-length of the most unstable density fluctuation is close to the limiting lattice constant in the nuclear phase. {\textcopyright} 1971.},

We consider observational constraints on the ratio of massive star types and the distribution of stellar remnant masses. We describe the identification of supernova progenitors in our models, and demonstrate a good agreement to the properties of observed progenitors. We also test our models against photometric and spectroscopic observations of unresolved stellar populations, both in the local and distant Universe, finding that binary models provide a self-consistent explanation for observed galaxy properties across a broad redshift range. Finally, we carefully describe the limitations of our models, and areas where we expect to see significant improvement in future versions.},

abstract = {When a core-collapse supernova occurs in a binary system, the surviving star as well as the compact remnant emerging from the supernova may reach a substantial space velocity. With binary population synthesis modelling at solar and one-fifth of solar metallicity, we predict the velocities of such runaway stars or binaries. We compile predictions for runaway OB stars, red supergiants and Wolf-Rayet stars, either isolated or with a compact companion. For those stars or binaries which undergo a second stellar explosion we compute their further evolution and the distance travelled until a Type II or Type Ibc supernova or a long or short gamma-ray burst (GRB) occurs. We find our predicted population of OB runaway stars broadly matches the observed population of stars but, to match the fastest observed Wolf-Rayet runaway stars, we require that black holes receive an asymmetric kick upon formation. We find that at solar metallicity Type Ic supernova progenitors travel shorter distances than the progenitors of other supernova types because they are typically more massive and thus have shorter lifetimes. Those of Type IIP supernovae can fly farthest about 48pc on average at solar metallicity, with about 8per cent of them reaching 100pc. In considering the consequences of assuming that the progenitors of long GRBs are spun-up secondary stars that experience quasi-homogeneous evolution, we find that such evolution has a dramatic effect on the population of runaway Wolf-Rayet stars and that some 30per cent of GRBs could occur a hundred parsec or more from their initial positions. We also consider mergers of double compact object binaries consisting of neutron stars and/or black holes. We find the most common type of visible mergers are neutron star-black hole mergers that are roughly 10 times more common than neutron star-neutron star mergers. All compact mergers have a wide range of merger times from years to Gyr and are predicted to occur 300 times less often than supernovae in the Milky Way. We also find that there may be a population of low-velocity neutron stars that are ejected from a binary rather than by their own natal kick. These neutron stars need to be included when the distribution of neutron star kicks is deduced from observations. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are understood to be the final fate for a subset of massive, stripped envelope, rapidly rotating stars. Beyond this, our knowledge of the progenitor systems is limited. Using the BPASS (Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis) stellar evolution models, we investigate the possibility that some massive stars in binaries can maintain the angular momentum required for jet production, while still loosing their outer envelope through winds or binary interactions. We find that a total hydrogen mass of MH {\textless} 5 × 10−4 M and a helium ejecta mass fraction of FHe {\textless} 0.20 provide the best thresholds for the supernova II/Ibc and Ib/Ic divisions respectively. Tidal interactions in binaries are accounted for by applying a tidal algorithm to post-process the stellar evolution models output by BPASS. We show that the observed volumetric gamma-ray burst rate evolution can be recreated using two distinct pathways and plausible distributions for burst parameters. In the first pathway, stars are spun up by mass accretion into a quasi-homogeneous state. In the second, tides maintain rotation where otherwise the star would spin down. Both lead to type Ic supernova progenitors, and a metallicity distribution consistent with the GRB host galaxy population. The inferred core angular momentum threshold for jet production is consistent with theoretical requirements for collapsars, given the assumptions made in our model. We can therefore reproduce several aspects of core collapse supernova/GRB observation and theory simultaneously. We discuss the predicted observable properties of GRB progenitors and their surviving companions.},

abstract = {The formation of stars above about 20M ⊙ and their apparently high multiplicity remain heavily debated subjects in astrophysics. We have performed a vast high-resolution radial velocity spectroscopic survey of about 250 O- and 540 B-type stars in the southern Milky Way which indicates that the majority of stars ({\textgreater}82percent) with masses above 16M ⊙ form close binary systems while this fraction rapidly drops to 20percent for stars of 3M ⊙. The binary fractions of O-type stars among different environment classes are: clusters (72 ± 13percent), associations (73 ± 8percent), field (43 ± 13percent) and runaways (69 ± 11percent). The high frequency of close pairs with components of similar mass argues in favour of a multiplicity originating from the formation process rather than from a tidal capture in a dense cluster. The high binary frequency of runaway O stars that we found in our survey (69percent compared to 19-26percent in previous surveys) points to the importance of ejection from young star clusters and thus supports the competitive accretion scenario. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

Here we estimate that Australian astronomers' total greenhouse gas emissions from their regular work activities are ≳25 ktCO2e yr–1 (equivalent kilotonnes of carbon dioxide per year). This can be broken into {\~{}}15 ktCO2e yr–1 from supercomputer usage, {\~{}}4.2 ktCO2e yr–1 from flights (where individuals' flight emissions correlate with seniority), {\textgreater}3.3 ktCO2e yr–1 from the operation of observatories, and 2.6 ± 0.4 ktCO2e yr–1 from powering office buildings. Split across faculty scientists, postdoctoral researchers and PhD students, this averages to ≳37 tCO2e yr–1 per astronomer, more than 40{\%} greater than the average Australian non-dependant's emissions in total, and equivalent to around five times the global average. To combat these environmentally unsustainable practices, we suggest that astronomers should strongly preference the use of supercomputers, observatories and office spaces that are predominantly powered by renewable energy sources. Where current facilities do not meet this requirement, their funders should be lobbied to invest in renewables, such as solar or wind farms. Air travel should also be reduced wherever possible, replaced primarily by video conferencing, which should also promote inclusivity.},

We model GW150914-GBM as both a weak, on-axis short GRB and normal short GRB seen far off axis. Given the large uncertainty in the position of GW150914, we determine that the best chance of finding the afterglow is with ASKAP or possibly the MWA, with the flux from an off-axis short GRB reaching 0.2 - 4 mJy (0.12 - 16 mJy) at 150 MHz (863.5 MHz) by 1 - 12 months after the initial event. At low frequencies, the source would evolve from a hard to soft spectrum over several months. The radio afterglow would be detectable for several months to years after it peaks, meaning the afterglow may still be detectable and increasing in brightness NOW (mid-July 2016). With a localization from the MWA or ASKAP, the afterglow would be detectable at higher radio frequencies with the ATCA and in X-rays with Chandra or XMM.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) display a bimodal duration distribution with a separation between the short- and long-duration bursts at about 2 s. The progenitors of long GRBs have been identified as massive stars based on their association with Type Ic core-collapse supernovae (SNe), their exclusive location in star-forming galaxies, and their strong correlation with bright UV regions within their host galaxies. Short GRBs have long been suspected on theoretical grounds to arise from compact object binary mergers (neutron star-neutron star or neutron star-black hole). The discovery of short GRB afterglows in 2005 provided the first insight into their energy scale and environments, as well as established a cosmological origin, a mix of host-galaxy types, and an absence of associated SNe. In this review, I summarize nearly a decade of short GRB afterglow and host-galaxy observations and use this information to shed light on the nature and properties of their progenitors, the energy scale and collimation of the relativistic outflow, and the properties of the circumburst environments. The preponderance of the evidence points to compact object binary progenitors, although some open questions remain. On the basis of this association, observations of short GRBs and their afterglows can shed light on the on- and off-axis electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources from the Advanced LIGO/Virgo experiments.

These advances have opened new perspectives on the nature and properties of burst central engines, interactions with the burst environment from microparsec to gigaparsec scales, and the possibilities for nonphotonic signatures.

We review here the growing evidence for and theoretical implications of this association, and conclude that most long-duration soft-spectrum GRBs are accompanied by massive stellar explosions (GRB-SNe). The kinetic energy and luminosity of well-studied GRB-SNe appear to be greater than those of ordinary SNe, but evidence exists, even in a limited sample, for considerable diversity. The existing sample also suggests that most of the energy in the explosion is contained in nonrelativistic ejecta (producing the supernova) rather than in the relativistic jets responsible for making the burst and its afterglow. Neither all SNe, nor even all SNe of Type Ibc produce GRBs. The degree of differential rotation in the collapsing iron core of massive stars when they die may be what makes the difference.

abstract = {The neutron star merger, GW170817, was followed by an optical-infrared transient (a kilonova) which indicated that a substantial ejection of mass at trans-relativistic velocities occurred during the merger. Modelling of the kilonova is able to constrain the kinetic energy of the ejecta and its characteristic velocity but, not the high-velocity distribution of the ejecta. Yet, this distribution contains crucial information on the merger dynamics. In this work, we assume a power-law distribution of the form E({\textgreater} $\beta$$\Gamma$) ($\beta$$\Gamma$)-$\alpha$ for the energy of the kilonova ejecta and calculate the non-thermal signatures produced by the interaction of the ejecta with the ambient gas. We find that ejecta with minimum velocity $\beta$0 0.3 and energy E ∼1051 erg, as inferred from kilonova modelling, has a detectable radio, and possibly X-ray, afterglow for a broad range of parameter space. This afterglow component is expected to dominate the observed emission on a time-scale of a few years post-merger and peak around a decade later. Its light curve can be used to determine properties of the kilonova ejecta and, in particular, the ejecta velocity distribution $\alpha$, the minimum velocity $\beta$0, and its total kinetic energy E. We also predict that an afterglow rebrightening, that is associated with the kilonova component, will be accompanied by a shift of the centroid of the radio source towards the initial position of the explosion.},

abstract = {If the emission of gamma-ray bursts were as a result of the synchrotron process in the standard internal shock scenario, then the typical observed spectrum should have a slope Fv ∝ v-1/2, which strongly conflicts with the much harder spectra observed. This directly follows from the cooling time being much shorter than the dynamical time. Particle reacceleration, deviations from equipartition, quickly changing magnetic fields and adiabatic losses are found to be inadequate to account for this discrepancy. We also find that in the internal shock scenario the relativistic inverse Compton scattering is always as important as the synchrotron process, and faces the same problems. This indicates that the burst emission is not produced by relativistic electrons emitting synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation.},

abstract = {Brief, intense bursts of $\gamma$-rays occur approximately daily from random directions in space, but their origin has remained unknown since their initial detection almost 25 years ago. Arguments based on their observed isotropy and apparent brightness distribution are not sufficient to constrain the location of the bursts to a local or cosmological origin. The recent detection of a counterpart to a $\gamma$-ray burst at other wavelengths has therefore raised the hope that the sources of these energetic events might soon be revealed. Here we report spectroscopic observations of the possible optical counterpart to the $\gamma$-ray burst GRB970508. The spectrum is mostly featureless, except for a few prominent absorption lines which we attribute to the presence of an absorption system along the line of sight at redshift z = 0.835. Coupled with the absence of Lyman-$\alpha$ forest features in the spectra, our results imply that the optical transient lies at 0.835 ≤ z ≤ 2.3. If the optical transient is indeed the counterpart of GRB970508, our results provide the first direct limits on the distance to a $\gamma$-ray burst, confirming that at least some of these events lie at cosmological distances, and are thus highly energetic.},

The data are compared with predictions from a wide range of models, providing the first detailed comparison between non-trivial cocoon and jet models. Homogeneous and power-law shaped jets, as well as simple cocoon models are ruled out by the data, while both a Gaussian shaped jet and a cocoon with energy injection can describe the current data set for a reasonable range of physical parameters, consistent with the typical values derived from short GRB afterglows. We propose that these models can be unambiguously discriminated by future observations measuring the post-peak behaviour, with Fv ∝ t{\~{}}-1.0 for the cocoon and Fv ∝ t{\~{}}-2.5 for the jet model.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts are often modelled as jet-like outflows directed towards the observer; the cone angle of the jet is then commonly inferred from the time at which there is a steepening in the power-law decay of the afterglow. We consider an alternative model in which the jet has a beam pattern where the luminosity per unit solid angle (and perhaps also the initial Lorentz factor) decreases smoothly away from the axis, rather than having a well-defined cone angle within which the flow is uniform. We show that the break in the afterglow light curve then occurs at a time that depends on the viewing angle. Instead of implying a range of intrinsically different jets - some very narrow, and others with a similar power spread over a wider cone -the data on afterglow breaks could be consistent with a standardized jet, viewed from different angles. We discuss the implication of this model for the luminosity function.},

abstract = {Two binary neutron star mergers, GW170817 and GW190425, have been detected by Advanced LIGO and Virgo. These signals were detected by matched-filter searches that assume that the star's orbit has circularized by the time their gravitational-wave emission is observable. This suggests that their eccentricity is low, but full parameter estimation of their eccentricity has not yet been performed. We use gravitational-wave observations to measure the eccentricity of GW170817 and GW190425. We find that the eccentricity at a gravitational-wave frequency of 10 Hz is e = 0.024 and e = 0.048 for GW170817 and GW190425, respectively (90 per cent confidence). This is consistent with the binaries being formed in the field, as such systems are expected to have circularized to e = 10-4 by the time they reach the LIGO-Virgo band. Our constraint is a factor of 2 smaller that an estimate based on GW170817 being detected by searches that neglect eccentricity. However, we caution that we find significant prior dependence in our limits, suggesting that there is limited information in the signals. We note that other techniques used to constrain binary neutron star eccentricity without full parameter estimation may miss degeneracies in the waveform, and that for future signals, it will be important to perform full parameter estimation with accurate waveform templates.},

Our pursuit of more than a century to uncover the origins and fate of these cosmic energetic particles has given rise to some of the most interesting and challenging questions in astrophysics. Within our own galaxy, we have seen that energetic particles engage in a complex interplay with the galactic environment and even drive many of its key characteristics (for more information, see the first white paper in this series). On cosmological scales, the energetic particles supplied by the jets of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are an important source of energy for the intracluster and intergalactic media, providing a mechanism for regulating star formation and black hole growth and cultivating galaxy evolution (AGN feedback)23. Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows encode information about their circumburst environment56, which has implications for massive stellar winds during previous epochs over the stellar lifecycle. As such, GRB afterglows provide a means for studying very high-redshift galaxies since GRBs can be detected even if their host galaxy cannot50. It has even been suggest that GRB could be used to measure cosmological distance scales if they could be shown to be standard candles.},

abstract = {In the new era of gravitational wave (GW) and multi-messenger astrophysics, the detection of a GW signal from the coalescence of a black hole – neutron star (BHNS) binary remains a highly anticipated discovery. This system is expected to be within reach of the second generation of ground-based detectors. In this context, we develop a series of versatile semi-analytical models to predict the properties of all the electromagnetic (EM) counterparts of BHNS mergers. We include the nuclear-decay-powered kilonova emission, its radio remnant, the prompt emission from the jet, and the related afterglow. The properties of these counterparts depend upon those of the outflows that result from the partial disruption of the NS during the merger and from the accretion disc around the remnant, which are necessary ingredients for transient EM emission to accompany the GW signal. We therefore define ways to relate the properties of these outflows to those of the progenitor binary, establishing a link between the binary parameters and the counterpart properties. From the resulting model, we anticipate the variety of light curves that can emerge after a BHNS coalescence from the radio up to gamma-rays. These light curves feature universal traits that are the imprint of the dynamics of the emitting outflows, but at the same time, they show a clear dependence on the BH mass and spin, but with a high degree of degeneracy. The latter can be deduced by a joint GW – EM analysis. In this paper, we perform a proof-of-concept multi-messenger parameter estimation of a BHNS merger with an associated kilonova to determine how the information from the EM counterpart can complement that from the GW signal. Our results indicate that the observation and modelling of the kilonova can help to break the degeneracies in the GW parameter space, leading to better constraints on the BH spin, for example.},

These afterglow observations have uncovered 71 X-ray detections, 30 optical/NIR detections, and 4 radio detections. Employing the standard afterglow synchrotron model, we perform joint probability analyses for a subset of 38 short GRBs with well-sampled light curves to infer the burst isotropic-equivalent energies and circumburst densities. For this subset, we find median isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray and kinetic energies of E{\_}gamma,iso{\~{}}2x10{\^{}}51 erg, and E{\_}K,iso{\~{}}(1-3)x10{\^{}}51 erg, respectively, depending on the values of the model input parameters.

Such collisions will produce a characteristic burst of gravitational radiation, which may be the most promising source of a detectable signal for proposed gravity-wave detectorsl. Such signals are sufficiently unique and robust for them to have been proposed as a means of determining the Hubble constane. However, the rate of these neutron-star collisions is highly uncertain 3 • Here we note that such events should also synthesize neutron-rich heavy elements, thought to be formed by rapid neutron capture (the r-process)4. Furthermore, these collisions should produce neutrino bursts S and resultant bursts of JI-rays; the latter should comprise a subclass of observable JI-ray bursts. We argue that observed r-process abundances and JI-ray-burst rates predict rates for these collisions that are both significant and consistent with other estimates. The binary pulsar system will coalesce in roughly 10 8 yr. Using this fact together with the pulsar birth rate and the observed frequency of occurrence of close binary pulsars (then, one in every 300 pulsars), Clark et al. 3 estimated the formation rate in the Galaxy to be (3 ± 1.6) x 10-4 yr-!, As 450 pulsars have now been observed, this estimate should be decreased by a factor of 1.5, but this does not change the following discussion. The natural progenitor for a close neutron-star binary system is a massive X-ray binary, from which the neutron-star binary will form following a supernova explosion. Clark et ae estimated that the probability of disruption of such a close binary in the 126 transition state or the lack of hydrogen bonds from N caps to the exposed backbone NH groups of the helices.

Among the important quantities to measure are the mass and velocity of the ejecta produced by the tidally disrupted NSs and the delay - if any - between the merger and the launching of a relativistic jet. These encode information on the equation of state of the NS, the nature of the merger remnant, and the jet launching mechanism, as well as yielding an estimate of the mass available for r-process nucleosynthesis. Here we derive analytic estimates for the structure of jets expanding in environments with different density, velocity, and radial extent. We compute the jet-cocoon structure and the properties of the broadband afterglow emission as a function of the ejecta mass, velocity, and time delay between merger and launch of the jet. We show that modeling of the afterglow light curve can constrain the ejecta properties and, in turn, the physics of neutron density matter. Our results increase the interpretative power of electromagnetic observations by allowing for a direct connection with the merger physics.},

In this paper, we present a composite semi-analytical model to predict the properties of the expected EM counterpart from BHNS mergers, focusing on the kilonova emission and on the gamma-ray burst afterglow. Four main parameters rule the properties of the EM emission: the NS mass {\$}M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}NS{\}}{\$}, its tidal deformability {\$}\backslashLambda{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}NS{\}}{\$}, the BH mass and spin. Only for certain combinations of these parameters an EM counterpart is produced. Here we explore the parameter space, and construct light curves, analysing the dependence of the EM emission on the NS mass and tidal deformability. Exploring the NS parameter space limiting to {\$}M{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}NS{\}}-\backslashLambda{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}NS{\}}{\$} pairs described by a physically motivated equations of state (EoS), we find that the brightest EM counterparts are produced in binaries with low mass NSs (fixing the BH properties and the EoS). Using constraints on the NS EoS from GW170817, our modeling shows that the emission falls in a narrow range of absolute magnitudes. Within the range of explored parameters, light curves and peak times are not dissimilar to those from NSNS mergers, except in the B band. The lack of an hyper/supra-massive NS in BHNS coalescences causes a dimming of the blue kilonova emission in absence of the neutrino interaction with the ejecta.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\#}VanguardSTEM is an online community and platform that centers women, girls, and non-binary people of color in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. We publish original and curated content, using cultural production to include a multiplicity of identities as worthy of recognition and thus redefine STEM identity and belonging. {\#}VanguardSTEM is rooted firmly in Queer, Black feminisms which delineate the experiences and critiques of Black women matter and that these insights can foster a restorative and regenerative construction of the cultures in which we exist. In describing how {\#}VanguardSTEM descended from counterspaces, we draw on speculative fiction to define a {\#}VanguardSTEM hyperspace as a fluid “place-time” that is born digital and enabled by social media, but materializes in the physical world for specific purposes. As Black women in STEM, we consider how our situated knowledges and scientific expertise inform our process. We propose an intersectional scientific methodology to address the influence of embodied observation, embedded context and collective impact on scientific inquiry. Through {\#}VanguardSTEM, we assert, without apology, the right of Black, Indigenous, women of color to self-advocate by fully representing ourselves, our STEM identities and interests, without assimilation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The central engine in long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is thought to be a compact object produced by the core collapse of massive stars, but its exact nature (black hole or millisecond magnetar) is still debatable. Although the central engine of GRB collapsars is hidden to direct observation, its properties may be imprinted on the accompanying electromagnetic signals. We aim to decipher the generic properties of central engines that are consistent with prompt observations of long GRBs detected by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Adopting a generic model for the central engine, in which the engine power and activity timescale are independent of each other, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of long GRBs produced by jets that successfully breakout from the star. Our simulations consider the dependence of the jet breakout timescale on the engine luminosity and the effects of the detector's flux threshold. The two-dimensional (2D) distribution of simulated detectable bursts in the gamma-ray luminosity versus gamma-ray duration plane is consistent with the observed one for a range of parameter values describing the central engine. The intrinsic 2D distribution of simulated collapsar GRBs peaks at lower gamma-ray luminosities and longer durations than the observed one, a prediction that can be tested in the future with more sensitive detectors. Black-hole accretors, whose power and activity time are set by the large-scale magnetic flux through the progenitor star and stellar structure, respectively, are compatible with the properties of the central engine inferred by our model.},

@article{Bonning2012,
abstract = {We present multiwavelength data for 12 blazars observed from 2008 to 2010 as part of an ongoing optical-infrared photometric monitoring project. Sources were selected to be bright, southern ($\delta$ {\textless} 20°) blazars observed by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. Light curves are presented for the 12 blazars in BVRJK at near-daily cadence. We find that optical and infrared fluxes are well correlated in all sources. Gamma-ray bright flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) in our sample have optical/infrared emission correlated with gamma-rays consistent with inverse Compton-scattering models. In FSRQs, variability amplitude increases toward IR wavelengths, consistent with the presence of a thermal accretion disk varying on significantly longer timescales than the jet. In BL Lac objects, variability is mainly constant, or increases toward shorter wavelength. FSRQs have redder optical-infrared colors when they are brighter, while BL Lac objects show no such trend. Several objects show complicated color-magnitude behavior: AO0235+164 appears in two different states depending on its gamma-ray intensity. OJ287 and 3C279 show some hysteresis tracks in their color-magnitude diagrams. Individual flares may be achromatic or otherwise depart from the trend, suggesting different jet components becoming important at different times. We present a time-dependent spectral energy distribution of the bright FSRQ 3C454.3 during its 2009 December flare, which is well fit by an external Compton model in the bright state, although day-to-day changes pose challenges to a simple one-zone model.

@article{Paczynski1986,
abstract = {We propose that some, perhaps most, gamma-ray bursters are at cosmological distances, like quasars, with a redshift z « 1 or z » 2. This proposition requires a release of supernova-like energy of about 1051 ergs within less than 1 s, making gamma-ray bursters the brightest objects known in the universe, many orders of magnitude brighter than any quasars. This power must drive a highly relativistic outflow of electron-positron plasma and radiation from the source. The emerging spectrum should be roughly a black body with no annihilation line, and a temperature T « ({\pounds}/47rr0 2a)1/4. As an example the spectrum would peak at about 8 MeV for the energy injection rate of ¿ = 1051 ergs s-1 and for the injection radius r0 = 10 km. We propose that three gamma-ray bursts, all with identical spectra, detected from B1900 + 14 by Mazets, Golenetskii, and Gur'yan and reported in 1979, were all due to a single event multiply imaged by a gravitational lens. The time intervals between the successive bursts, 10 hr to 3 days, were due to differences in the light travel time for different images. The required mass of the lens is 1010 M0, just right for a galaxy.},
